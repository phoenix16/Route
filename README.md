# Route
Route to your favorite destinations using your fingerprints!

This is an Android app that lets a user associate a location on google maps with an enrolled fingerprint.
This creates location shortcuts that can be accessed with one's fingerprints. 
This app links the Samsung Fingerprint API with the Google Maps API to associate each fingerprint with a chosen location.

Sample usage:

Imagine you are driving in downtown San Francisco looking for parking. Instead of looking for parking in Google Maps on your phone while driving distractedly, you could touch your phone's fingerprint sensor to get driving directions to the closest parking lot.

For example, program the fingerprint sensor with 
  - finger 1 to route home
  - finger 2 to route to closest parking lot
  - finger 3 to route to closest gas station.
  
This app has been tested on a Samsung Galaxy S5, which permits a user enroll up to 3 fingerprints.
