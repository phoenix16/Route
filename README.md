# Route
Route to your favorite destinations using your fingerprints!

This is an Android app that lets a user associate a location on google maps with an enrolled fingerprint.
This creates location shortcuts that can be accessed with one's fingerprints. 
This app links the Samsung Fingerprint API with the Google Maps API to associate each fingerprint with a chosen location.

Sample usage:

Imagine you are looking for parking in downtown San Francisco. Touching the fingerprint sensor on your phone will route you to the nearest parking lot.

Associate each enrolled fingerprint with a destination. For example,
  - finger 1 to route home
  - finger 2 to route to nearest parking lot
  - finger 3 to route to nearest gas station.
  
This app has been tested on a Samsung Galaxy S5, which permits a user enroll up to 3 fingerprints.
