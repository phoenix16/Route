# Route
Route to your favorite destinations using your fingerprints!

Android app that links the Samsung Fingerprint API with the Google Maps API so that each of the user's registered fingerprints
can be programmed to route to a particular location.

For example, touch/swipe the fingerprint sensor with 
  - finger 1 to route to your home location
  - finger 2 to route to closest parking lot
  - finger 3 to route to closest gas station.
  
This app has been tested on a Samsung Galaxy S5, which permits a user register up to 3 fingerprints.
