# Route
Route to your favorite destinations using your fingerprints!

This is an Android app that lets a user associate a location on google maps with a particular enrolled fingerprint.
This creates location shortcuts that can be accessed with one's fingerprints.

This app links the Samsung Fingerprint API with the Google Maps API to associate each fingerprint with a chosen location.

For example, touch/swipe the fingerprint sensor with 
  - finger 1 to route home
  - finger 2 to route to closest parking lot
  - finger 3 to route to closest gas station.
  
This app has been tested on a Samsung Galaxy S5, which permits a user register up to 3 fingerprints.
