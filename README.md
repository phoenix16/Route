# Route
Route to your favorite destinations using your fingerprints!

This is an Android app that lets a user associate a location on google maps with an enrolled fingerprint.
It creates location shortcuts that can be accessed with one's fingerprints. 

Sample usage:

Imagine you are looking for parking in downtown San Francisco (a near impossible feat). Instead of looking for a parking lot on Google maps while driving distractedly, you could instead touch the fingerprint sensor on your phone to route to the nearest parking lot.

Associate each enrolled fingerprint with a destination. For example,
  - finger 1 to route home
  - finger 2 to route to nearest parking lot
  - finger 3 to route to nearest gas station.
  
This app links the Samsung Fingerprint API with the Google Maps API to associate each fingerprint with the Lat/Long coordinates of a chosen location. Tested on a Samsung Galaxy S5, which permits a user enroll up to 3 fingerprints.
